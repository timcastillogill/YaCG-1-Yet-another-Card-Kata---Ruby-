# YaCG-1-Yet-another-Card-Kata---Ruby-

This is a codewar Kata that was made for Javascript but I have completed it using ruby complete with Rspec unit tests.

Original kata can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59767719c74de3b2d100002c/train/javascript)

## Instructions

### To run tests on

1. Use `git clone` to make a local clone of this repo
2. Run `bundle install` to get Rspec and other gems installed
3. In the command line run `rspec` and you will see my tests all passing
